#Solution

#profit for each month
profit <- revenue- expenses
profit

#profit after tax for each month (the tax rate is 30%)
tax <- round(profit * 0.3, digits = 2)
tax

profit.after.tax <- profit - tax
profit.after.tax

#profit margin for each month - equals to profit after tax divided by revenue
profit.margin <- round(profit.after.tax / revenue,2) * 100
profit.margin

#good months- where the profits after tax was greter than the mean for the year
mean_pat <- mean(profit.after.tax)
mean_pat
good.months <- profit.after.tax > mean_pat
good.months

#bad months- where the profits after tax was less sthan the mean for the year
bad.months <- !good.months
bad.months

#the best month- where the profits after tax was max for the year
best.month <- profit.after.tax == max(profit.after.tax)
best.month

#the worst month- where the profit after tax was min for the year
worst.month <- profit.after.tax == min(profit.after.tax)
worst.month
